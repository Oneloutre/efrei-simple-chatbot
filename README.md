This project is a simple chatbot made in python for an Efrei project. It is based on a simple GUI in the CLI and a simple chatbot engine made by us.

<u>Here is what it can do for now :</u>

- [x] Display the list of the least important words in the corpus of documents.
- [x] Display the word(s) with the highest TF-IDF score.
- [x] Identify the word(s) most frequently repeated by President Chirac.
- [x] Identify the name(s) of the president(s) who have spoken about the "Nation" and the one who has repeated it the most times.
- [x] Identify the first president to discuss climate and/or ecology.
- [x] Excluding words labeled as "non-important," what word(s) have all presidents mentioned.
